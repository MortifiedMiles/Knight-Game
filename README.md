# Knight-Game

Object-Oriented python game created using pygame

My first project, and first attempt at creatign my own github repository

Player character moves back and forth to dodge arrows

Next Steps:

Sound Effects, a Winning Animation, a Background that scrolls upwards, hair.

Hair could be created in sections to follow a spline model from the center-top down to the knight's position
